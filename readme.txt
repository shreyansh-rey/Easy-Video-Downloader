Note:
1) Make sure you have Python and Pip installed in your computer.
	You can get it from here : https://www.python.org/downloads/
	Pip usually comes with your python installation.
2) Run Dependencies.exe atleast once before running the main application.
	It'll download gallery-dl in your device, you don't need to run it afterwards.
3) The config file contains the destination folder where videos/images/gifs will be downloaded.
	Double click and open it using notepad to edit it, there is an example destination in the config file.
		Still here's an example : 
			D:\My-Folder
	You can name the folder anything you want to, if the folder doesn't exists then a folder with that name will be created.
